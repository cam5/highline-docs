## Get Started

The store's development url is: [http://highline-apparel-2.myshopify.com](http://highline-apparel2.myshopify.com)

* (TL;DR - [How do I log in?]({% post_url 2015-10-03-logging-in %}))

Some quick background: we've utlized [Shopify](http://www.shopify.com) as our eCommerce framework. It's the same framework that we used to build the new Me to We Style retail site.

### What this document *is*

<u>This document aims to function as a manual for HLN team members who use the store's interface to carry out their day-to-day work.</u>

The secondary aim is to outline the additional configuration and third-party applications that our store uses in order to meet our business's objectives.

**Why would our store be configured any differently fron the next Shopify store?** We will use our Shopify store in a wholesale capacity, where Shopify primarily functions as an eCommerce service for retail merchants.

### What this document *isn't*
It's definitely not the Shopify documentation. That lives over [here](https://docs.shopify.com/)

__What does it mean to *"not be the Shopify Documentation"*?__ It means that you won't find information in here that deals with basic eCommerce operations like creating a product, or general information about navigating a shopify admin screen, etc.

Some examples of what you might not find here, but that you would find in the Shopify docs can be found on [this page]({% post_url 2015-10-03-shopify-documentation %}).
