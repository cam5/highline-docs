## Who Sees What, When?

Since time immemorial, philosophers have grappled with the big questions: *Where did we come from?*, *Why are we here?*, and *Where do we go when we die?*. Contemporary philosophers have us contemplating a new head-scratcher: **"Can one purchase from HighLine Apparel without being a PPPC member?"**

They've concluded that &mdash; upon further reflection &mdash; the answer is an emphatic **no**.

But still, there is philosophical head-space to explore here. What would this **look** like?

Wow. Who knew!

Let's try a thought experiment. Close your eyes and imagine a world where you're a PPPC member. Imagine a form where you could input your information. Great. Now imagine that when you submit that form, HLN gets a notification that you want to open an account with them!

Some distinguished artists have rendered an impressive sketch of what this fantasy land might look like:

Let's take it a step further. Pretend that this pings an HLN email address about the sign-up, and assigns an Account Manager to handle it. Now imaging this all happens in the familiar google docs interface.

Wow.

How would we create their customer profile, and let them know about it?

It might look something like this:

Great. Now open your eyes. A logged in user might see something like this:
