## What <u>A hypothetical user</u> sees:

*Please note that the current images are pulled from a work in progress. Although we begin by looking at the product page, the full user flow will begin at the <u>home page</u>, travel to a <u>category page</u>, and __then__ arrive at one of these <u>product pages</u>.*

### 1. The Product Page:

This page allows the customer to:

* Preview the product's images
* Toggle between colors
* View the quantity breaks offered (only when logged in)
* Input the quantities of sizes that they'd like to purchase for a given color / product.
* Add those sizes to the cart.

Note - the user will need to click "Add to cart" to update their cart and see the confirmed price-range of their selection; it can't be shown in real-time on this page, on account of the store's configuration.

### 2. The Cart Page:

This page gives the customer a preview of their cart's contents, and:

* *On a color by color basis*, calculates what level of price break they get per color, per style.
* Provides a link to edit the quantity per size, of any color.
* Summarizes their order for them.

Let us assume that the customer wants to add another set of tees to their cart, of the same Unisex Crew Neck T-shirt, but this time, in white.

They could either click a link below the product-color's title that says "Edit qty., or select another color.", or click the "Keep Shopping" link at the bottom

### 3. The Product Page (again):

Presume that the user's clicked on the product name in the cart, and returned to the original product page. From here, they can select a different color via the color swatch selector, and enter that color's size quantities into the cart once more.

Let's assume that we've added a large number of `Electric Blue` tees, and look at the cart, now.

### 4. The Cart Page (again):

We can see here, that the user has added 200 total `Electric Blue` tees, which puts them above 75+ for that particular color. From here, they can check out.

### 5. The Checkout Process.

Then, the user enters their billing information:

Finally, they select a payment method, and complete their order.

If the user wants to add graphics to their order, they can select a special payment method named "**I want to add graphics to this order of blank tees, and will pay later.**", or something else snappy.


### 6. The Confirmation Email.

**Please remember that this is still a work in progress, and is subject to super-duper facelifts**, this is just for illustrative purposes.

## What now?

Whether or not the user indicated that they'd like to add graphic design, the next stage in the process is to learn what information HLN will receive and act on.
