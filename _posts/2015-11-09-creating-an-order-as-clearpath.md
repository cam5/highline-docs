To place orders on behalf of ClearPath Promotions, you will need to use a <u>customer accountu</u> to add the items to the cart, at the `CPP` pricing level.

Please note that your CPP **customer account** is entirely separate from your HighLine **admin account**.

### Logging in as a ClearPath customer for the first time.

Please sign up here: [http://highlineapparel.com/account/register](http://highlineapparel.com/account/register).

Once you've done so, please notify Cameron or Juliana, in order to have your account flagged as a CPP member.

### Placing orders as ClearPath

Once logged in as a CPP member, you'll be able to browse the store and add items to the cart as a regular user would. Once primary difference is that these product's names all read ` [CPP]` at the end.
