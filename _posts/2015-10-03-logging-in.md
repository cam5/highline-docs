## Prerequisites

* A modern browser. (Just try to avoid anything below Internet Explorer 9, and you'll be fine).

---------------------

# Log in as an Administrator

The administrative account is used to manage, and add to existing orders. It will most often be used to follow instructions laid out in [Account Manager Order Flow]({% post_url 2015-10-03-account-manager-order-flow %}).

## Accessing The Administrator Log-in Screen

1. Point your browser to [https://highlineapparel.com/admin/](https://highlineapparel.com/admin/), and you'll be prompted to log in with your username & password.

2. You're in! That was easy.

---------------------

# Log in as a CPP Customer

Loggin in as a CPP customer is distinct from logging in as an adminsitrator. An admin account is closer in nature to your role as an account manager. In contrast, the CPP customer account enables you to use the storefront as a customer with access to special CPP pricing.

## Accessing the customer login screen.

1. Point your browser to [https://highlineapparel.com/account/login/](https://highlineapparel.com/account/login/), and you'll be prompted to log in with your *customer* username & password.
